    "\n",
    "Now that you've gotten an introduction to collaborative filtering and recommendation systems, it's time to put your skills to test and build a recommendation system for a real world dataset! For this lab, you'll be using a dataset regarding the book reviews on the Amazon marketplace. While the previous lesson focused on user-based recommendation systems, you'll apply a parallel process for an item-based recommendation system to recommend similar books at the bottom of the product page.\n",
